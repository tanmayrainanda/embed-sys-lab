## Project Overview üåê

This lab focuses on integrating actuators such as **Servo Motors, DC Motors, and Relays** into embedded systems, and controlling them using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** and **PID (Proportional Integral Derivative)** concepts. The lab encourages hands-on learning through practical challenges, including controlling motor speeds and participating in a **Robot Arm Mini-Challenge**.

Additionally, the lab includes an **Obstacle Detection and Collision Detection Project** using ultrasonic sensors and the **GY-521 IMU Data Visualization Project**:

- **GY-521 IMU Data Visualization:** Logs IMU data to CSV for real-time tracking and visualization.
- **Obstacle Detection and Collision Detection:** Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and assess sudden collision events based on abrupt deceleration changes captured by the GY-521 IMU.
